# ü§ù Integrating NEAR into Your Application

{% hint style="info" %}
Many projects coming into the ecosystem are wondering what a NEAR integration looks like. At NEAR we encourage both apps to build native decentralized web applications, but we also have infrastructure that makes it extremely easy to transition Web2 or Web "2.5" applications into Web3 tech.
