# ü§ù Integrating NEAR into Your Application

{% hint style="info" %}
Many projects coming into the ecosystem are wondering what a NEAR integration looks like. At NEAR we encourage both apps to build native decentralized web applications, but we also have infrastructure that makes it extremely easy to transition Web2 or Web "2.5" applications into Web3 tech.
{% endhint %}

## Sign in with NEAR

* NEAR Wallet Selector [https://github.com/near/wallet-selector](https://github.com/near/wallet-selector)&#x20;

## Swaps

Say you need to swap from one funible token like USDC into another funible token in order to facilaite things like in-game currencies, DeFi, etc. On the backend you can integrate Refv2 (Ref.finance is NEAR's leading AMM).

## EVM Integration

## Your Own EVM

Build your own public EVM chain on the Aurora Shard on NEAR with Aurora Cloud Silos. Setup your own blockchain with your own validator requirements, choose your gas token, have the rainbow bridge built in, interact with other silos and have the ability to pay for transactions on behalf of users.



## Private Enterprise Blockchain with Calimero

Want to leverage the infrastructure of NEAR without exposing your network to the public blockchain. Well with Calimero Network you can deploy you favorite NEAR dApps, and all your business functions on a private shard and easily deploy to NEAR mainnet if needed.&#x20;
