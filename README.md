# ðŸ›  Developer Onboarding

**NEAR Development Resources** There are many places to find information about developing smart contracts and applications on NEAR Protocol. This document will highlight the most important resources starting with a high level architectural overview of NEAR application development.

## **Why NEAR?**

Since inception NEAR has been touted for its technical excellence, unique approach to scalability unlike any other chain, and superior account model leading to some of the best user onboarding experiences. As NEAR is moving into its 3rd year since mainnet, there are over 1000 verified applications across the 3 major categories of crypto: DAOs, DeFi and NFTs. In addition to applications, NEAR has a number of infrastructure projects addressing the growing ecosystem needs in areas such as: private shards and compute ([https://www.calimero.network/](https://www.calimero.network/)), storage ([https://www.onmachina.io/](https://www.onmachina.io/)), wallet interoperability ([https://github.com/near/wallet-selector/](https://github.com/near/wallet-selector/)), core protocol governance ([https://mobile.twitter.com/neardc](https://mobile.twitter.com/neardc)), and more ([https://near.org/](https://near.org/))

## Dev Resources

****[**nomicon.io** ](https://nomicon.io/)

Low level protocol documentation. If you are a blockchain engineer interested in contributing to the core protocol, this is your source of truth (e.g. nomicon explains how NEAR implements Merkle Proofs). Also enumerates NEPs and their specifications. I think Pagoda's protocol team has ownership of this.



****[**docs.near.org**](https://docs.near.org/)****

Developer documentation. If you are a web2 or web3 dev interested in learning what NEAR is, and how to implement a dApp, this is your page

Doesn't mention NEPs, but how to implement it (e.g. FT, NFT, and how to make a marketplace).&#x20;

Pagoda's DevRel is DRI

Information about everything the protocol has to offer including usage, infrastructure, opportunities, and guilds".&#x20;

## :handshake: Integrating NEAR into Your Application

Many projects coming into the ecosystem are wondering what a NEAR integration looks like. At NEAR we encourage both apps to build native decentralized web applications, but we also have infrastructure that makes it extremely easy to transition Web2 or Web "2.5" applications into Web3 tech.
