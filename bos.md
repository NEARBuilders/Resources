NEAR is the Blockchain Operating System

The Blockchain Operating System (BOS) allows end users to quickly discover the possibilities of Web3 and gives developers the ability to code interfaces in a single environment and then fork components to build faster and more efficiently

## Examples of BOS Viewers

In the recent months there has been a proliferation of BOS Viewers

For all the BOS viewers view the BOS directory widget [https://bos.gg/#/onboarder.near/widget/BOSDirectory](https://bos.gg/#/onboarder.near/widget/BOSDirectory) &#x20;



If you are interested in building your own BOS viewer, join the NEAR Social Developer telegram at [https://nearbuilders.com/tg-social  ](https://nearbuilders.com/tg-social)
